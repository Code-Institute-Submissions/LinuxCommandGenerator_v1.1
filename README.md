# Linux Command Generator
## Code Institute Milestone Project 2: Interactive Front End Development

### What is it?

A web app where users can get app, theme, and icon-pack installation commands for a variety of Linux distributions. The current selection is limited to distros I personally use regularly but I would like to expand in the future.

### UX
The site is intended to be above all else, clean and simple. It was developed mobile first and should be easy & pleasant to use regardless of user device. I deliberately wanted to avoid navbars and multi-page linking to keep the site as simple to use and navigate as possible. The colour scheme is and fonts should suggest a 1950s retro style as I wanted bold, bright, and vibrant (bordering on gaudy) look.

#### User Stories
- As a Linux user I would like a simple repository of useful commands which is easy to navigate and understand.
- As a lay user the commands and instructions should be clear and easily followed.
- As a power user I want to be able to easily copy specific commands to achieve my goal of installing an app/icons/themes

#### Strategy
The command generator concept occurred to me when I was trying to think of a project which I personally would find useful and which got me excited. As someone who frequently "distro hops" to try out different Linux distros I often have to spend time googling commands to install apps/icons/themes I regularly use because there are too many to memorize. I wanted a site that could be quickly & easily used to retrieve such commands and which I could expand in the future to include more Linux distros and obviously more apps/icons/themes.

Eventually I would like to update the site so that rather than downloading a HTML file of the commands, users can download a install script to run on the specified distro. My knowledge of bash & shell scripts is not yet good enough to achieve this so the HTML download was a middle-ground. I would also like to impliment an "Email Commands" functionality so that users can email themselves the list of individual commands they need.

### Features
The site is intentionally easy to navigate to avoid needing a navbar or page links. Clicking on a button should immediately take the user to the next step in the process. Materialize.CSS was used to make the site responsive and to enable the pleasant "flat" style design elements to keep things easy on the eyes.

### Features to implement in the future
- "Email Command to Me" function so users can email the command(s) they need to themselves
- "Report bug" feature for users to report if/when a command stops functioning and needs to be revisited
- A simple interface for adding more distros/apps/icons/themes which doesn't require manually adding to the distros script

#### Deployment
LinuxCommandGenerator is hosted on GitHub pages and deployed from the master branch. Any changes committed to the master branch will automatically update on the GitHub deployment.

To run the site locally you can clone it using the following instructions:
- Create a folder in the desired location on your computer.
- Open a terminal ([Mac instructions](https://macpaw.com/how-to/use-terminal-on-mac)|[Windows instructions](https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-open-terminal-in-windows)|[Linux instructions](https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/22283/four-ways-to-get-instant-access-to-a-terminal-in-linux/))
- Navigate to the folder you created using `cd` command (e.g. `cd ~/Documents/LinuxCommandGenerator`)
- Type `git init`
- Next type `git clone https://github.com/nealbrophy/LinuxCommandGenerator`
- To break the link between your local copy and the repo at https://github.com/nealbrophy/LinuxCommandGenerator type `git remote rm origin`

### How do I use it?
- 1.) Select the name of the appropriate Linux distro.
- 2.) Select the name of the app, theme, or icon-pack you want to install.
- 3.) See the CLI commands in the output section.
- 4.) Copy to clipboard and paste into your terminal (all of these commands require super user permissions, please make sure you have this before proceeding).
- 5.) If you would like to collect multiple app/theme/icon commands, simply click the "add to list/save for later" button then continue collecting more commands as needed.
- 6.) When you have collected all the commands you need (see Step 5 above) you can download them as a nicely formatted .html file.

### Testing

#### Automated End-to-End
The project was NOT developed using TDD practices as I was not yet comfortable enough with my JS knowledge to do so. Instead I opted for end-to-end testing using Cypress.io. The tests were written to validate:
- That the page loads ok
- That the default/start state is blank and the output & list areas were empty
- That each distro behaves as expected such that the `ouput` and `instructions` elements populate expected contents
- That the `sidebar` element was hidden until it's trigger-button is clicked
- That the "download as file" button successfully downloads a file with the name "linux-commands.html"

##### How to run Cypress tests
- First clone the repo as discribed [above](#deployment).
- Next make sure you have nodeJS installed (if not [install it](https://nodejs.org/en/))
- Open Visual Studio Code and open a terminal (`Ctrl+Shift+`)
- Make sure you're in the root directory of the repo (if not use the `cd` command in terminal to navigate there)
- In terminal type `npm init` and fill out the fields as desired
- In terminal type `npm install cypress --save-dev`
- Once the install process finishes, launch Cypress by typing `npx cypress run` (if you run into problems [check the documentation](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line.html#Installation))
- When the Cypress GUI launches simply click on the name of the test script `commandGeneratorTests.spec.js` and the tests will run
- The test scipt can be found in `Cypress > Integration` folder within the root directory

#### Manual testing
In addition to the automated end-to-end tests described above the site was also rigourously tested via simple user interaction. These tests were carried out using Firefox and Chrome on a variety of Linux distributions (Elementary, Endeavour, Ubuntu, Solus) and using the in-browser developer tools. The following items were tested:
- Clicking app/icon/theme buttons prior to Distro button should present a message in the output section advising user to select a distri
- Apps/Icons/Themes which are not available for selected distro should appear as disabled/inactive
- Clicking "Copy" and "Add to list" buttons before making a valid selection should present the user with a warning message of same
- Sidebar trigger should only pulse when items are in the list and stop when the list is cleared
- Clicking clicking "Download as file" after user has cleared the list should notify user that the list is empty.

#### Validation
- HTML was validated using [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/)
    - **NOTE**: The Markup Validator presents multiple errors for the "cy-data" property, however, this has no effect on the code and is considered best practice for testing with Cypress.
- CSS was validated using [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
- JS was validated using [JSHint](https://jshint.com/)

#### Open Bugs:
- Copy text button presents "Copy unsuccessful" toast during cypress test but present "Copy successful" in manual testing.
- Having `scroll-behavior: smooth` enabled in the stylesheet causes some Cypress tests to fail.

#### Squashed Bugs: 
- If "Add To List" button was clicked after an OS had been selected but before an app had been selected the addToList function would run and add an "undefined" item to the list which would in turn be added to the sidebar and output to file.
    - __FIX__: Add if statment to prevent addToList from running unless both distro and app/icon/theme selections had been populated and present warning msg to user if not.
- If "Add To List" button was clicked after after an app had previously been added and after a new distro had been selected bbut before a an app for the newly selected distro has been selected the previously added app would populate even though user hadn't selected it for the new distro choice.
    - __FIX__: Reset "selection" variable to undefined every time a distro choice button is clicked.    
- Clicking "Copy Code" button before anything had been selected would present confirmation that copy was successful but there was nothing to copy.
    - __FIX__: Add if statement to check that distro and app/icon/theme selection had both been made. If not, present msg saying nothing to copy.
- Clicking "Download File" button would execute as expected but if user then opened sidebar and clicked "Download" button the same file would download even though no items were present in the saved list.
    __FIX__: Added final action after Download File listener executes to overwrite the dataOuput variable with an empty string.
- Copy Code functionality didn't work for the code from notSure selection. Having this ability for other code but not the code to determine which OS user is running seemed counterproductive and not great UX.
    - __FIX__: Refactored commandGenerator script to accept notSure as valid choice for the purposes of running the copyToClipBoard and downloadFile functions. Achieved by moving the if statement (to validate distro/app selection) from within the copyToClipboard & downloadFile functions to within the click-listener "Add to List" button listener (that way statement is evaluated prior to calling addToList function and doesn't interfere with copyToClipboard/downloadFile).
